        Historically speaking, protests have been able to bring to the light issues that had been undetected and overlooked by the masses. Communities that are underserved and ignored can use protests to make noise about their issues and their suggestions for change. For example, in Benyamin article, they mention the protest of coal miners in the US and the UK. A group that usually would not have much attention was able to make a difference for their people by means of protest. Furthermore, protest allow for unity and camaraderie. People are able to gather on the basis of a shared community and struggle. These are things that can bring even a diverse group of people together because of intersectionality. Ultimately, protest have been shown to work. Even if the goal is not met, protests allow for recognition and visibility.

        On the other hand, Benyamin does mention that there have been many times where protest was shown not to work. Benyamin says, “protests alone do not achieve change”. They mention the Civil Rights Movement and state that although there was much protest going on, there were also other aspects like Martin Luther King Jr’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Put concisely, Benyamin states that “protests can win exposure for a cause, but they do not fight legal battles that make change possible”.

        Resnik from Vox reports that there are “4 rules for making a protest work, according to experts”. The first step is to push the importance of the message by protesting for an extended period of time, rallying together hundreds of people, being attached to political organizations, amongst many. Another key rule is to unite similar or related protests into one overarching cause. For example, Resnik mentions the Women’s March and report that’s “21 percent were there to protest Trump’s attitude toward immigration, 23 percent were concerned with social welfare, and 34.7 percent were there for LGBTQ issues”. This way, many, maybe smaller causes, are getting the attention they need. Third, Resnik writes that it is important to do more than protest and take action. Many of the issues protested are political issues that require legal action so along with protesting, people must get involved in politics in a more official way. Lastly, Resnik states that protests in efforts to prevent something from happening are more successful than protests against something has already been done.

        Mampilly, in his TED Talk, says that protest is a necessary part of democracy. Otherwise, we are depending on the social elite to represent, ordinary, everyday people. After his experience visiting various African countries, he reports that their use of nonviolent protest is necessary since their “democratically elected leaders… have done little to improve the conditions for ordinary people”. This is something that many people, even in America feel. Mampilly believes that protest is a way that we can “work to center ordinary people in democratic life”. Afterall, we cannot realistically expect these few selected elites can really give the normal people what they need. They need to hear from us and although protests are not always 100% successful, protests act as our united voices for people in power to hear.
