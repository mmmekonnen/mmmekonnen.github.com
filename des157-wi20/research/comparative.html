    <h3>Go Fund Me</h3>

    <p>
        Go Fund Me is a well-known tool for individuals to locate cases that they wish to donate to and for individuals to post their needs for others to donate towards. As a new user it is nice to see that I do not have to make an account to browse through fundraisers. The site is not asking much of the user before the user sees what this site has to offer. They have ways to narrow your search through predetermined categories, but I find that once I decide to look through a certain category, there is not additional layer of filtering. A user might want to narrow their search again by location, time posted or through a number of other filters. Once a user is on the page for a specific fundraiser, the layout is clear and provides a good amount of information. The call-to-action “donate” is in a bright yellow button that is easy to find and encourages a user to take action. There is also an option to “share” which I would consider a secondary call-to-action as raising money for the cause depends on having more people see the fundraiser. There is not any motion design used, but the there is a consistent and impactful use of icons that allows the user to quickly evaluate the meaning of various buttons and pieces of information. The green color used for most of their site and logo is appropriate as this is a site having to do with money. Emotionally, I think people would be encouraged to donate by the easy-to-use, light and rounded nature of this site. I would not say that this site brings out any overwhelming emotions, but for someone who knows why they are visiting this site, it is welcoming and intuitive.  Also, I see that they have added a “new” feature on their homepage that reads “For nonprofits”. This is a neat feature in that nonprofit organizations can pair with Go Fund Me to help get more traffic and action on their causes. Go Fund Me is no longer limited to the individual, but is extended to greater, community causes.

    <h3>Resistance Near Me</h3>

        I had never heard of Resistance Near Me, but after my initial research I found that they are a site that is doing something very similar to what I plan to put together. The logo and imagery on this homepage evoke more emotion than the Go Fund Me site. It shows signs and protesting which encourages people to take action and make a difference. For some reason, I find that this site does not look as “professional” and I think it is due to the choice of font. Anyways, I like the options that they provide to narrow your volunteer search by member, party, state and event type. Although these are good ideas for tools, when I actually try to use these features, there seems to be some glitches. For example, if you try to input a state, but have the map zoomed into an area that does not include that state, it seems to get confused and just freezes. Overall, the map section on the homepage is difficult to use because it is seemingly set to a specific location in Illinois and I am unsure how to change it. Also, somehow after selecting my party and then trying to unselect that filter by clicking the “x” next to the name of the party, I have selected it again. Now I have democratic twice in my filter bar as seen below.

        There is no use of motion graphics and little use of icons. I am not getting any satisfaction in terms of feedback, making this site a little frustrating to use. As a user I can also submit an event for people to attend and fortunately, this section of the site seems very simple and straightforward with a list style array of text entry boxes. Although this is very intuitive it is not memorable or satisfying necessarily so I still think there is room for improvement there. It seems like a standard Google Forms page. Overall, I think the concept is great and the ideas for features are smart, but the development could have been better.
