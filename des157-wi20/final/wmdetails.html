    <main>
        <p>About 10,000 protesters peacefully rallied to the Civic Center Plaza. This protest in January fo 2020 was the fourth edition of this event which began in the heat of the Trump election. Various speakers and performers volunteered, kicking off the event.</p>
        <p>This rallying has helped spread the news about Trump’s inappropriate comments and “jokes”. It showed society that women today will no longer accept such behavior and that women are demanding to be heard. Women are demanding change.</p>
        <p>Although attendance has been declining at each annual March, this protest has not lost steam as people have begun to find other ways to be involved in protest as well. Hashtags like #nastywomen and #togetherwerise have taken over Twitter and other forms of media.</p>
        <p>The point of this protest was to draw attention to the unacceptable behavior of Donald Trump and of the patriarchal society overall. Many would say that this goal has been met considering the novelty of this cause and the amount of coverage it has received through the news and various forms of media.</p>
