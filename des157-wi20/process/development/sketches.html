        I like the idea of making the landing page very straight forward and productive in that it allows you to get to your desired tasks straight away. I figured that the two most important tools of this site was to:
        <ol>
            <li>find a protest opportunity near you</li>
            <li>post a protest that you are hosting</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Asking for the information right on that landing page minimizes clicks and I think it can avoid a lot of room for confusion. Once the user selects their desired action, there is a follow up page that allows for more specification. For example on the page labeled "Find a Protest Near You!", there is a chance to input other information besides your location. This includes criteria like political party affiliation, the kind of protest, and the cause of the protest. Furthermore, a user should be able to sort be various criteria like the date, popularity or distance from the user. On the other page, "Post Your Protest", a user has the chance to further discribe their event and cause as well as share the event on various social media besides this site. When a user finds a protest that they want to attend, they can look at the description page of the event and get details like the specific location, time and date as well as friends that are attending this event if they like their social medias to this site. A user can RSVP for the event, bookmark it or share it on their social media.
